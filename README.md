# PHP Test Project

### Description
This is a very simple one-page application consisting of just one table (representing users of some company),
and a form for creating new rows. To make it a little more complicated, we have written a 'framework' you will have to use.
Bellow is set of simple tasks to perform.

### Preparation steps
1. Create new MySQL database
2. Rename `config/database` to `config/database.php` and configure you database connection settings in this file
3. Import `database/schema.sql` into your database

### Tasks to perform
1. Style the page using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/):
  * Every other table row should be highlighted.
  * Use Bootstrapâ€™s form-horizontal to style the form.
  * Any other styling changes should be made based on your consideration.
2. Add a validation of the new records.
3. Create a JS functionality to filter rows by city.
4. Implement submission of the form using AJAX.
5. Add column phone number to the table.
6. Make your work available online (share the URL) as well as return back in a zip package.
